# a-window-into-html
A (satirical) page about Microsoft using HTML and CSS (and a bit of JS).

## Spaghetti Code
The page was coded with time-saving on mind so it's not very clean. The JS has been done inline, which normally I would separate into different files (like the CSS).

## Easter Egg
The easter egg was done using the awesome p5js library.
