# a-window-into-html

This page shares some (satirical) information about Microsoft while using different HTML tags to learn about them. I alse introduced some CSS & JS to spice up the page.

## Navigation

The web page is formed by 4 pages

1 - [About Us](https://jgcardelus-gitt-pat.github.io/a-window-into-html/index.html)

2 - [Surface](https://jgcardelus-gitt-pat.github.io/a-window-into-html/hardware.html)

3 - [Store](https://jgcardelus-gitt-pat.github.io/a-window-into-html/store.html)

4 - [Credits](https://jgcardelus-gitt-pat.github.io/a-window-into-html/credits.html)

### About Us

In this section we see some div, header, p, hX and tables in action. There is also a not-so-hidden easter egg. The easter egg was coded in JS using the amazing [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library.

### Surface

In Surface we see some images.

### Store

Store contains a form, some inputs and buttons. The form doesn't do much, but it looks pretty cool.

### Credits

Here the libraries used get credit.

## Spaghetti Code

The page was coded with time-saving on mind, so the code it's not really clean and does not follow the DRY principle. The quality of the code will be improved in future projects.
