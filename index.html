			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p>
				We are a company that cannot get it's head straight. We have
				awesome products like Azure and VSCode but we have no idea on
				how to make a OS. Our backwards compatibility, while necessary,
				makes updating core feature of the OS impossible and destroys UI
				cohesiveness. We also have amazing projects like our AR glasses
				that have gained no traction and our hardware products are so
				overpriced that almost no one buys it, except the Surface.
				Surface is cool. We aso tried doing phones once, do you remeber
				that? Of course not, no developers developed for Windows Phone
				so no apps were available and switching was horrible, so no one
				did.
			</p>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>What products do we offer?</h2>
			<p>Among other things, we offer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Windows 11 - Our OS. It sucks. It's slow and the UI it's not
					cohesive.
				</li>
				<li>
					Surface - Our hardware. It's a bit overpriced, but they are
					really nice.
				</li>
				<li>
					Azure - Our cloud computing. This is actually really good,
					but AWS keeps beating us in sales.
				</li>
				<li>
					Open source projects - Recently we've started to do some
					open source projects which are awesome (like VSCode).
				</li>
				<li>
					Edge - This is our browser... well it's not. It runs on
					Chromium so it's basically Chrome with a face-lift. Google
					is so cool.
				</li>
				<li>
					VSCode - We had to mention it twice, it's awesome. Best text
					editor ever. The bad thing (or not, it depends) it's that it
					also runs on Chromium through Electron, so it's also
					Google's.
				</li>
				<li>
					Office - We have the monopoly on office stuff. Google Docs
					is cathing up but let's be honest, Word can't be beaten.
				</li>
			</ul>
